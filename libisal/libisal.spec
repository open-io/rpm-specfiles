%description
Collection of low-level functions used in storage applications.
Contains fast erasure codes that implement a general
Reed-Solomon type encoding for blocks of data that helps protect against
erasure of whole blocks. The general ISA-L library contains an expanded
set of functions used for data protection, hashing, encryption, etc.
.
This package contains the shared library.
